Fixes/Changes to be Considered
==============================

It is questionable that the column display for the table view is
driven entirely by the table model.  This should be the default
(probably), but it shouldn't be the th only option.  Otherwise, the
same model can't feed two different table views viewing different
columns.

This can probably be handled simply by layering additional
functionality on top of the existing treeview, but it needs some more
considered analysis before implementation begins.
